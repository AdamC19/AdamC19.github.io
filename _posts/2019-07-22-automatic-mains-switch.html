<h2 class="center-all">Overview</h2>
<p>I initially got this idea from a project by woodworker John Heisz who built an <a href="https://ibuildit.ca/projects/simple-load-sensing-automatic-switch/">automatic mains switch</a>. His design is elegantly simple, but a few things I don't like about it are that it requires around a 10A load to trigger the secondary circuit, it requires a special large-ish transformer, and it can only successfully trigger a solid state "relay". This is all fine I guess, but I wanted to try my hand at a similar switch that would trigger at lower load current and energize an electro-mechanical relay, meaning it could be adapted to switch a DC load or signal another device if desired. </p>

<p>I wanted to use a simple current-sense transformer and detect a load using a peak-detector circuit. I found a small toroidal inductor core, around which I wrapped several turns of 14 AWG solid-core copper wire as the primary and a dozen or so turns of 22 AWG solid-core wire as the secondary. I then put together the following circuit:</p>
