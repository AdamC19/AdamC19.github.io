<h2 class="center-all">Overview</h2>
<p>I got interested in builing a Tesla coil when I saw YouTuber <a href="http://www.electroboom.com/">ElectroBOOM</a>'s videos on Tesla coils. I was also influenced by the <a href="http://onetesla.com/">OneTesla</a> design (which ElectroBOOM reviews on his channel). What I wanted was a circuit that would play high fidelity music, similar to ElectroBOOM's design and unlike the OneTesla design. It needed to be solid state, and naturally I wanted the biggest arcs possible.</p> 
<p>Like ElectroBOOM's design, I planned for my driver to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil#Types">continuous wave type</a>. My primary requirement for my control circuit was that it shall lock on to the resonant frequency of the secondary coil. ElectroBOOM notes that the lack of this feature is a shortcoming of his design. The OneTesla design also lacks secondary feedback, instead opting for a primary LC circuit that resonates close enough to the nominal resonant frequency of the tower.</p>
