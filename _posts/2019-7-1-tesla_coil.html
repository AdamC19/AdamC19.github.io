<h2 class="center-all">Overview</h2>
<p>I got interested in builing a Tesla coil when I saw YouTuber <a href="http://www.electroboom.com/" target="_blank">ElectroBOOM</a>'s videos on Tesla coils. I was also influenced by the <a href="http://onetesla.com/" target="_blank">OneTesla</a> design (which ElectroBOOM reviews on his channel). What I wanted was a circuit that would play high fidelity music, similar to ElectroBOOM's design and unlike the OneTesla design. It needed to be solid state, and naturally I wanted the biggest arcs possible.</p> 
<p>Like ElectroBOOM's design, I planned for my driver to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil#Types" target="_blank">continuous wave type</a>. My primary requirement for the control circuit was that it shall lock on to the resonant frequency of the secondary coil. ElectroBOOM notes that the lack of this feature is a shortcoming of his design. The OneTesla design also lacks secondary feedback, instead opting for a primary LC circuit that resonates close enough to the nominal resonant frequency of the tower.</p>


<h2 class="center-all">Circuit Overview</h2>

<p> Below is a high level schematic of my circuit. Important thing to note: the half-bridge is driving an LC circuit, however it is NOT used as a RESONANT LC circuit. The half-bridge is switched at the resonant frequency of the secondary LC circuit - the purpose of the capacitor (we'll call it the coupling capacitor) is to simply pass the AC voltage produced by the half-bridge while blocking any DC that might occur (such as when there is no PWM input signal). In fact, if we were to drive that LC circuit at it's resonant frequency with the half bridge, we would indeed get a large (desirable) voltage on the primary, but would swiftly destroy our half-bridge. When this LC circuit is resonating, the voltage across the primary is reaching several kilovolts in amplitude, making the voltage across the coupling capacitor also several kilovolts and allowing large current to flow through it when either FET is on, causing our FET's to experience very high current, so you want this LC circuit to resonate at a frequency not reached control circuit. Of course, I'm living life on the edge with my LC circuit's resonant frequency at ~570kHz, but all my coils tend to resonate at less than 500kHz. Fingers crossed.

<h3 class="center-all">Choice of Switching Device</h3>
<p> With all power electronics, the choice of switching device is critical. In more traditional Solid State Tesla Coil (SSTC) circuits, the switches exist to simulate a spark gap, and by firing the "spark gap" at audible frequencies, tones can be produced. Usually, designers choose IGBTs for their ability to withstand high voltage and relatively high current, plus the insulated gate is a nice feature. IGBT's are somewhat slow, and generally good for sub-200kHz switching. For my continuous wave design, however, I needed to switch the half bridge at the resonant frequency of the secondary, which I predicted would be between 300 kHz and 1 MHz or more. This required fast switches, which meant MOSFET's. MOSFET's are notoriously sensitive and easily destroyed, so careful design is a must. My first choice was to use Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET's, which can withstand voltages comparable to IGBT's, have very low gate charge (10's of nano-Coulombs), low R<sub>DS(ON)</sub>, and nice thermal properties. My first choice was the Cree/Wolfspeed <a href="https://www.wolfspeed.com/c3m0120090d" target="_blank">C3M0120090D</a>, but I later switched to the <a href="https://www.wolfspeed.com/c3m0065090D" target="_blank">C3M0065090D</a> in favor of its lower R<sub>DS(ON)</sub>.</p>
