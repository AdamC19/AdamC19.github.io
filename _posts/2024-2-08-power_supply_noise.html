<p>I bought this cheap switching power supply as a college student for less than $50. It goes up to 60V at 5A. Going up to 60V was the main reason I chose it over others. What any casual user of this supply quickly realizes is that it pollutes any circuit with copious amounts of noise. But where is all this coming from, and is there an effective way to combat it for casual bench use?</p>

<p>This goes to show that what we're dealing with is primarily common-mode noise. </p>
