I&apos;m a sophomore at <a href="http://case.edu" target="_blank">Case Western Reserve University</a> studying Elecrical Engineering.
</p>

<h2>CWRUbotix</h2>
<p>I am a member of <a href="http://cwrubotix.case.edu" target="_blank">CWRUBotix</a>, Case Western&apos;s Undergraduate Robotics club, and the team&apos;s elected Lab &amp; Safety Manager. My involvement with the team began in my freshman year (2016).
<h3>2017-18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This year I&apos;m on the club&apos;s <a href="http://cwrubotix.case.edu/nasa_rmc.html" target="_blank">NASA Robotic Mining Challenge (RMC)</a> Team. I&apos;m contributing as a member of the hardware subteam, which deals with the robot&apos;s electrical power and control. More specifically, I&apos;m contributing to the &quot;Locomotion&quot; sub-system team, which deals with designing and building the robot&apos;s drive train.</li>
	<li>I was elected Lab &amp; Safety Manager. This role involves keeping our robotics lab stocked with tools and supplies, keeping it clean, neat, and organized, and making sure it&apos;s safe for working in (craft lab-safety rules, provide PPE, etc.). It also makes me a member of the club&apos;s executive board.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2016-17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Member of the club&apos;s <a href="http://www.thenrc.org" target="_blank">NRC</a> Non-Tactile Maze Robot team. I built a circuit that enabled the robot to efficiently sample 8 TOF ultrasonic distance sensors simultaneously. It uses capacitors and differential op-amps to give our microcontroller an analog signal that was proportional to the time of flight returned by the sensor. I designed the circuit based on a suggestion from our NASA team&apos;s hardware lead. I also wrote a google document analyzing the robot, intended as advice for a future team, that can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JjG9lMFF_pkVKb8wWEG9LCA54hgOyTaC4Vqfyfnx2y4" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

<h2>Case School of Engineering Web Support</h2>
<p>Since the Fall of 2016, I work part time for the Case School of Engineering Web Support &quot;dev ops integration&quot; team. My primary task is assisting with and training users in using the Drupal content management system. We&apos;re in the middle of a switch to a newer version of Drupal and as a result I&apos;ve also been tasked with self-teaching myself the new version then writing usage documentation for faculty and staff. I&apos;ve also gotten some contact with the LAMP stack webserver.</p>
