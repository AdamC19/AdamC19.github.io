<p>Welcome to my personal website. On this site, you can find information pertinent to my interests, projects, and work at <a href="http://www.marshall.edu">Marshall University</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a freshman at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH, planning to major in Electrical Engineering, and am interested in robotics as a career. I&rsquo;m currently a member of <a href="http://cwrubotix.case.edu">CWRUBotix</a>, the Case Western Robotics Team, and an intermittent member of the Case Western &quot;<a href="http://hacsoc.org">Hacker Society</a>&quot;. Prior to this, I was involved in VEX competitive robotics from 2012 - 2016 and am cofounder of <a href="http://backdrive.github.io/">VRC Team 8768A</a>. I also enjoy things like messing with electronics, recreational computer programming, hardware hacking, woodworking, playing the clarinet, and tropical fish keeping.</p>
