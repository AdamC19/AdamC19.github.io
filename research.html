<h2>2015 - 2016: Norton Lab</h2>
<p>During June and July of 2015, Adam worked as a lab assistant at the <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/mbic/" target="_blank">Marhsall University Molecular and Biological Imaging Center</a> (MU MBIC) for <a href="http://www.atomcrafters.com" target="_blank">Dr. Mike Norton</a>. Adam's experience has included Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), some Atomic Force Microscopy, and some work with DNA origami and gold nanoparticles. Primarily, Adam worked on designing and 3D printing parts for use in research. Adam became proficient in using Solidworks and ImageJ.</p>
<!--<p>Adam also operated the lab's <a href="http://www.lpfrg.com/" target="_blank">Leapfrog Creatr</a> 3D printer with moderate success. (Operating information and observations can be found in <a href="3dprinterreport.html">Adam's report on the Leapfrog Creatr</a>.)</p>
<p>Some designs can be found on Adam's thingiverse page which can be found <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/Adam_Cordingley/about" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>-->

<h2>2014</h2>
<p>During the spring of 2014, Adam conducted research using SEM studying the wear on oboe reeds due to playing over time. This was done in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/mbic/" target="_blank">MU MBIC</a> and <a href="http://www.richardkravchak.com" target="_blank">Dr. Richard Kravchak</a>, oboist and director of the <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/somt/music/" target="_blank">MU School of Music and Theatre</a>. Adam presented a poster on this project at Marshall's Sigma Xi day titled "Wear Analysis of Oboe Reeds with Scanning Electron Microscopy". The poster is displayed below and can also be viewed <a href="/img/sigma_xi_poster.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
