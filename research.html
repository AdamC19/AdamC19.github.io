<h2>2015</h2>
<p>During June and July of 2015, Adam worked as a lab assistant at the <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/mbic/" target="_blank">Marhsall University Molecular and Biological Imaging Center</a> (MU MBIC) for <a href="http://www.atomcrafters.com" target="_blank">Dr. Mike Norton</a>. Primarily, Adam worked on imaging Gold Nanoparticles using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).</p>
<p>Adam also operated the lab's <a href="http://www.lpfrg.com/" target="_blank">Leapfrog Creatr</a> 3D printer with moderate success. Adam's thingiverse page can be found <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/Adam_Cordingley/about" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>2014</h2>
<p>During the spring of 2014, Adam conducted research using SEM studying the wear on oboe reeds due to playing over time. This was done in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/mbic/" target="_blank">MU MBIC</a> and <a href="http://www.richardkravchak.com" target="_blank">Dr. Richard Kravchak</a>, oboist and director of the <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/somt/music/" target="_blank">MU School of Music and Theatre</a>. Adam presented a poster on this project at Marshall's Sigma Xi day titled "Wear Analysis of Oboe Reeds with Scanning Electron Microscopy". The poster is displayed below and can also be viewed <a href="/img/sigma_xi_poster.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
